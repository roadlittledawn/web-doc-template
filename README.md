* Two different automatically generated ToCs:
  * Fixed, hide-able TOC sidebar
  * Hide-able ToC at top of smaller screen sizes

* Pulldown menu of all docs in folder (upper right icon)

* Link to relevant Jira for doc

* Meta section for all meta fields in Drupal

* Clamshells as they appear in docs site
