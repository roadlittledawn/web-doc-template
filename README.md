# Documentation Draft and Collaboration Template
====================

## Purpose

Template for initial doc drafts to collaborate with SMEs prior to porting into Drupal. This avoids 
having to constantly create redirects and taxonomy modifications, as well as cluttering drafts views in Drupal.

## Use

Easiest way to review docs drafts is download the zip and open any of the files in `\docs` in a browser. Template
provides docs map in menu pull down, as well as doc TOC sidebar.
